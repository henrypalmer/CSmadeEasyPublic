This is a project written for the course Software Engineering and was my final project submission. This web app is written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project runs in
a Node.js environment using the modules express, bodyParser, request, and https. The app is hosted on Azure. It takes in the user's first and last name, email address, and passes
that info into MailChimp's API and adds to you to a mailing list. 
Thank you for checking this out!
